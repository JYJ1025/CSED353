Program Structure and Design of the TCPReceiver and wrap/unwrap routines:
<<<<<<< HEAD
- TCPReceiver traslate the wrapped seqno into the correct absolute seqno. 
- I used SYN, FIN related member variables to handle the wrapped seqno.
- For wrap function, I use modulo to traslate seqno and use plus, minus modulo for unrap function.

Implementation Challenges:
- It takes time to understand the relation between TCPrecevier, reassembler, bytestream.
- Finding correct unwrap function was hard.

Remaining Bugs:
- Having passed all the tests, there are no bugs I think.
